# Login and Registration System with Password Reset

This is a simple login and registration system developed with Tkinter, Python, and MySQL. The system allows users to register, log in, and change their passwords with a "forgot password" feature.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can register with email, username, and password.
- **User Login**: Registered users can log in with their username and password.
- **Password Recovery**: If users forget their password, they can request a password reset.
- **MySQL Database**: The system uses MySQL to store user information (username, email, and password).

###Important Note About Images
For the system to function properly, the images should be placed in the root folder (not inside the images folder).
This is because the application references the images directly by their filenames, and if they are inside a subfolder the paths won't be resolved correctly.
